Get ready, Bogotá! The official announcement is here: **Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) Colombia 2025** is a reality, and it's shaping up to be one of the most significant open-source events in Latin America this year.

Today, **August 29, 2025**, marks the day.

What makes this event so special isn't just its place as one of 30 global KCDs; it's the powerful collaboration it represents. The organizers are officially bringing together three of the most important movements in modern technology:

1.  **Cloud-Native (KCD):** The world of Kubernetes, containers, and DevOps.
2.  **OpenInfra:** The community behind the infrastructure that powers it all (like OpenStack, Ceph, and Kata Containers).
3.  **OSPO (Open Source Program Offices):** The enterprise and public-sector strategy for managing and contributing to open source.

This "super-event" in Bogotá is a space for innovation, learning, and high-level networking.

### Why This Combination is a Big Deal

This isn't just a co-location; it's a convergence. You can't have a successful cloud-native strategy without a robust infrastructure layer.

This event directly addresses the key questions on everyone's mind in 2025:

*   **The VMware Migration:** As companies flee Broadcom's new policies, where do they land? This event will be a hotspot for talks on migrating to KubeVirt and OpenStack.
*   **Powering AI at Scale:** The Cloud-Native world (Kubernetes) is how you *manage* AI workloads, but the OpenInfra world (OpenStack, Ironic) is how you *provide* the on-demand, cost-effective GPU and bare-metal resources.
*   **Digital Sovereignty:** For Colombia's booming FinTech and public sectors, this event brings together the OSPO (strategy) and OpenInfra (technology) for building secure, in-country clouds.
*   **A Pure Community Focus:** The event is 100% community-driven and non-profit, meaning the agenda is set by and for the engineers, architects, and innovators who are actively building this technology.

### How to Get Involved

While the event is happening today, the movement continues.

*   **🎟️ Registration:** Registrations are open for this accessible event.
*   **🎤 Call for Proposals (CFP):** The CFP has already concluded, leading to the fantastic schedule of talks you see today.
*   **🤝 Sponsorship:** Opportunities are available for companies who want to connect with and support this core cloud-native and open-source community.

This event positions Colombia as a major hub in the Latin American tech scene. Don't miss it.
